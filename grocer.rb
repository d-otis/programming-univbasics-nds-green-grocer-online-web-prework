  #   * `String`: name of the item to find
  #   * `Array`: a collection of items to search through
  # * Returns:
  #   * `nil` if no match is found
  #   * the matching `Hash` if a match is found between the desired name and a given 
  #     `Hash`'s :item key

def consolidate_cart(cart)
  # REMEMBER: This returns a new Array that represents the cart. Don't merely
  # change `cart` (i.e. mutate) it. It's easier to return a new thing.
    #   * Arguments:
    #   * `Array`: a collection of item Hashes
    # * Returns:
    #   * a ***new*** `Array` where every ***unique*** item in the original is present
    #     * Every item in this new `Array` should have a `:count` attribute
    #     * Every item's `:count` will be _at least_ one
    #     * Where multiple instances of a given item are seen, the instance in the
    #       new `Array` will have its `:count` increased
